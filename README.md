#100daysofmlcode

D-Day is here and finally, I am accepting 100 days of machine learning code challenge.

Starting from 06 Dec, 2020, I am accepting challenge, which is "100-Days-Of-Machine-Learning-Code" and the intuition behind this to dedicate at least one hour of every day for next 100 days in studying and/or coding Machine Learning. I will share my progress via

Motivation

By doing this challenge, I would like to learn more about Machine Learning. In addition to that, at the end of 100 days, I hope to have a rich portfolio of code, projects, and summary of the machine learning topics and models plus all of the additional content (available on internet) which I'll discover over the learning journey.

My aim throughout this process will be to learn as much as I can with accessible materials (mostly free) while always being sure to provide useful links that help someone who wants to learn machine learning. #100DaysOfMLCode
